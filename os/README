#	a few sample native ports for different architectures
ipengine	power	Bright Star Engineering (www.brightstareng.com) ipEngine-1
#					this port has only just been done (took a few hours)
#					and will be updated with FPGA support code later

js	sparc	original port to Javastation-1, not recently tested

mpc	power	basis for ports to Motorola MPC8xx boards, including FADS and ipengine

pc	386	basis for ports to various PC-based platforms

sa1100	arm	components of a sample Strongarm native kernel
#		unfortunately the full set including telephony support can't yet
#		be distributed -- we are looking for a readily available platform
#		for people to use for development

#			basic Inferno native kernel components
port	common	native operating system components
ip	common	Internet protocol stack, Ether and PPP media
kfs	common	native kernel file system (same format as Plan 9's kfs)
init	common	Limbo initialisation program (run by native kernel on startup)

#	sample bootstraps
boot	-	directory of several bootstrap programs; see README there
