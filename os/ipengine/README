The ipEngine-1 is a Motorola MPC8xx-based small computer
made by Bright Star Engineering (www.brightstareng.com)
which also provides Linux and their own operating system for it.
It is a good hardware platform to do network-oriented Inferno
applications.  We only just did the port, based on the
code in ../mpc.  The code probably should be merged back at some point.

The ipEngine is unusual in including an FPGA (Altera 6000).
The support for that in this release is not yet done.
It will be provided in a subsequent update.


Similarly, we haven't done the Intel-specific part of the flash
driver.  It will be provided shortly.

Booting the ipEngine

0.	serial cable (port 1, 9600 baud), ether, power etc.

1.	make appropriate entries in flash
	using the BSE monitor:

	set netmask 255.255.255.0
	set nameserver 200.1.1.67
	set gateway 200.1.1.90
	set hostname stella
	set domain bigbiz.com
	set myip 200.1.1.96

2.	add an entry to do the boot by tftp:

	set bootcmd "load /power/iipe 3000; go 3020"

	contrary to the BSE documentation this loads any
	binary file at the given address.  the -b option
	doesn't seem to be needed.

3.	reset
	it should load and start the kernel
