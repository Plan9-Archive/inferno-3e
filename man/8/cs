.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Cs
spawns a process that
serves a single file
.BR /net/cs ,
in the current name space,
answering requests by client processes
to translate symbolic network and service names into
instructions for connecting to the given service.
It is normally accessed by calls to
.IR sys-dial (2).
.PP
Each write to
.B /net/cs
is a network address of the same form
as the
.I addr
parameter to
.IR dial :
.IB network ! netaddr ! service
where
.I service
and
.I network
are optional.
The write returns an error if the address cannot be translated.
Otherwise, 
each subsequent read returns
end-of-file (if there are no further translations),
or a translation of the form:
.IP
.BI /net/ net /clone " address" ! port
.PP
The first field is the name of the
.I clone
file for a network interface.
To make a connection, open the file, and write the text in the second field.
There is a translation for each network and for each network address on which a symbolic
.I netaddr
is found.
The file offset should be set to 0 using
.IR sys-seek (2)
between the write and the read.
.PP
The file
.B /net/cs
persists until it is removed or unmounted from
.BR /net ,
or the
.I cs
process is killed
(see
.IR kill (1)).
Normally only one instance of
.I cs
is active; if it finds, when started, that
.B /net/cs
already exists, it prints a diagnostic and exits.
The
.B \-f
option forces
.I cs
to put a new
.B /net/cs
above the existing one in the current name space; subsequent translation
requests in the same name space will be resolved by the new instance.
The
.B \-v
option causes
.I cs
to print each translation request and results (if any) on standard error.
.PP
.I Cs
is normally started once, before other applications including
.IR srv (8).
(On Plan 9, Plan 9's native connection service will be used by default if Inferno's
.I cs
is not started.)
There are currently two versions:
.B lib/cs
is normally used on networked hosts with Ethernet access to a file server;
.B /svc/cs/cs
must be used on small clients that use PPP on a (dial-up) serial port for network access.
.PP
.I Csquery
queries the given
.I server
(default:
.BR /net/cs )
for a translation of each
.I address
and prints the results, one per line.
If no
.I address
is given,
.I csquery
prompts for address(es) to translate which it reads from the standard input,
printing the results of each translation on the standard output.
The
.B -x
option gives an alternative mount point for
.IR cs ,
when there is more than one network stack
(see
.IR ip (3)).
