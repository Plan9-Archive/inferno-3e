.TH LOGIND 8
.SH NAME
logind \- login daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lib/logind
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Logind
is normally started by
.IR srv (8)
to service requests on the
.B inflogin
TCP/IP port,
to provide a `signing' service (identity authentication) for a network.
Ultimately, the client receives a certificate that can be used to establish its identity
with any host that is willing to honour certificates from the certificate's signer.
.PP
The signer constructs the certificate from the contents
of the signer's key file
.BR /keydb/signerkey ,
typically created by
.IR createsignerkey (8),
and
the ID string and password supplied by the client (which are used to access
.B /keydb/password
via the
.B Password
module described in
.IR security-password (2)).
.PP
The protocol involves an exchange of information between the client and server. The client side of this exchange can be managed by the
.B Login
module; see
.IR security-login (2).
.PP
Client and server communicate over the Secure Socket Layer device
.IR ssl (3).
