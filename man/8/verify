.TH VERIFY 8
.SH NAME
verify \- command to authenticate receiver of blinded certificate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI lib/verify " set-top-box-id"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Verify
is run on a `signer' server to extract information from the
.BI /keydb/signed/ set-top-box-id
file created by
.IR signer (8).
That information consists of the previously crafted authentication certificate and the `blinded' version of the certificate that was sent to the requesting client.
.PP
.I Verify
displays the `blinded' version textually or graphically, as appropriate, so that it can be compared to that reported by the set-top-box owner over a secure independent mechanism (for example, telephone). If the operator of
.I verify
is convinced of the identity of the caller, the operator should accept when prompted by
.IR verify .
.I Verify
then writes the authentication certificate to
.BI /keydb/countersigned/ set-top-box-id,
as input for
.I countersigner
(see
.IR signer (8)).
.PP
.I Note:
if the operator of
.I verify
accepts the identity, the set-top-box owner should be requested
to answer `yes' to the prompt displayed by
.IR register (8).
The order of
acceptance (first on the signer) then on the client is
important.
