.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Listen
waits for an incoming network connection on any
given
.IR addr ,
(as accepted by
.B announce
in
.IR sys-dial (2))
and then invokes
.IR sh (1)
to run the associated
.IR command .
If the
.B -A
option is specified, no authentication or encryption will
take place on the connection; otherwise
.I listen
will attempt to authenticate the party at the other
end of the connection, allowing any given
.I alg
to be used to encrypt and/or digest the
connection's data.. If neither
.B -A
or any
.B -a
option is given, then
.I listen
will allow any algorithm allowed by the local
.IR ssl (3)
device.
If
.I keyfile
is specified, then it will be used as the server's certificate;
otherwise
.BI /usr/ user /keyring/default
will be used.
If an
.I initscript
is provided, it is executed by each listener
after announcing its network connection,
with the shell variable
.B net
set to the name of the corresponding network directory
(see
.IR sys-dial (2)),
before listening for incoming calls.
.PP
.I Dial
is the complement of
.IR listen .
It tries to make a connection to
.IR addr .
If the
.B -A
option is given, no authentication or encryption will
take place; otherwise Inferno authentication and encryption
will be performed as usual, using
.I alg
if given, or a default algorithm otherwise.
.I Keyfile
is used for the certificate if given, otherwise
.BI /usr/ user /keyring/ addr\fR,\fP
if it exists, and failing that,
.BI /usr/ user /keyring/default\fR.\fP
.I Alg
is used for the encryption/digest algorithm
on the connection.
When the connection is made,
.I command
is run in the context of that connection, as described below.
.PP
For both
.I dial
and
.IR listen ,
when the command is run,
.B $user
is set to the name of the authenticated user at the other
end of the connection (if authentication
is being used), and
.B $net
is set to the
.B /net
directory corresponding to the connection.
The standard input and output of the command
is redirected to the network connection (standard
error is unaffected).
.SH EXAMPLE
Run a custom login daemon and an echo server that
logs incoming connections:
.EX
listen (
	'tcp!*!echo' {
		echo got connection from `{cat $net/remote} >[1=2]
		cat
	}
	'tcp!*!inflogin' {
		customlogind
	}
)
.EE
Dial up the above echo server:
.EX
dial tcp!somehost!echo {echo made connection >[1=2]; echo hello}
