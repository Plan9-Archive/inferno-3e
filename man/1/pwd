.TH PWD 1
.SH NAME
pwd \- print working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
pwd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pwd
prints the path name of the working (current) directory.
It does not guarantee to return the same path that was used to enter the directory.
The returned path may be another route through the name space to the same working directory.
This behaviour arises when a combination of mounts or binds produces a graph in the file name space.
.SH SOURCE
.B /appl/cmd/pwd.b
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IR cd (1),
.IR bind (1),
.IR workdir (2)
.SH BUGS
The result can be wrong, particularly when the current directory
is on a remote machine or in a device hierarchy.
