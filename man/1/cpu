dials
.I host
(using network
.B tcp
if

is not given), exports the local namespace and executes the given
.I command
on that machine. The local namespace is visible to the
command in
.BR /n/client ;
local device files are bound into the remote device directory.
If
.I command
is not given, then
.B /dis/sh
is run.

The
.B -C
option sets the algorithm
to be used following authentication for digesting or encryption, to
.IR alg .
See

for the supported algorithms.
The default is

.SH BUGS
Although the draw device files are visible
to the remote command, the current implementation
of Tk means that windowing applications cannot
receive events when
run remotely. This will be fixed in a future release.
