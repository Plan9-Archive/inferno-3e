.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wm/license
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I License
displays the contents of the system licence file
.B /licencedb/LICENCE
and prompts the user to accept or reject the terms.
If the licence file does not exist the command exits
without displaying anything.
.PP
If the user accepts the terms of the licence then a file is
created in the
.B /licencedb
directory to indicate acceptance.
The filename is derived from the current user and host name as read from
.B /dev/user
and
.B /dev/sysname
respectively.
.PP
The acceptance file contains the text:
.IP
.IB Username @ Hostname
.I Timestamp
.PP
where
.I Timestamp
is the text read from the file
.B /dev/time
at the time of writing the acceptance file.
.PP
The name of the acceptance file is a 16 digit hexadecimal number.
The numeric value of the filename is formed as a 64-bit value with
.I userval
in the high-order 32 bits and
.I hostval
in the low-order 32 bits,
where
.I userval
and
.I hostval
are calculated from the username and hostname text by the following expression:
.I val
=
.RI SUM( text [ n ]
.RI "x 3^(" "len-n" )),
where
.I len
is the length of the text and
.IR text [ n ]
is the unicode code-point of the
.IR nth
