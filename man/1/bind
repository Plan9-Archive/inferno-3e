.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR bind
and
.IR mount
commands modify the file name space of the current process
and other processes in the same name space group
(see
.IR sys-pctl (2)).
For both calls, 
.I target
is the name of an existing file or directory in the
current name space where the modification is to be made.
.PP
For
.IR bind ,
.I source
is the name of an existing file or directory in the current name space.
After a successful
.IR bind ,
the file name
.I target
is an alias for the object originally named by
.I source ;
if the modification doesn't hide it,
.I source
will also still refer to its original file.
The evaluation of
.I source
(see
.IR sys-intro (2))
happens at the time of the
.IR bind ,
not when the binding is later used.
.PP
Both
.I source
and
.I target
files must be of the same type: either both directories or both files.
.PP
For 
.IR mount,
.I addr
is usually a network address for a machine acting
as a file server.
This argument should then conform to the conventions
described in
.IR sys-dial (2).
It can also be the name of a file that when opened gives a connection
to a file server.
The optional
.I spec
argument to
.I mount
is passed in the
.IR attach (5)
message and selects amongst different file trees offered by the server.
.PP
The effects of
.I bind
and
.I mount
can be undone by
.IR unmount .
If two arguments are given to 
.IR unmount ,
the effect is to undo a
.I bind
or
.I mount
with the same arguments. If only one argument is given, everything bound to or mounted on
.I target
is unmounted.
.SH OPTIONS
Options control aspects of the modification to the name space:
.TP 10
.B -r
The default option for both 
.IR bind
and
.IR mount  .
Replace the
.I target
file by the new one 
.I source.
Henceforth, an evaluation of the pathname
.I target
will be translated to the new file.
If they are directories (for
.IR mount ,
this condition is true by definition),
.I target
becomes a
.I "union directory"
consisting of one directory (the 
.IR source
directory).
.TP
.B -b
Both files must be directories.
Add the 
.IR source
directory to the beginning
of the union directory represented by the 
.IR target 
directory.
.TP
.B -a
Both files must be directories.
Add the 
.IR
source 
directory to the end
of the union directory represented by the 
.IR target 
directory.
.TP
.B -c
This can be used in addition to any of the above to permit
creation in a union directory.
When a new file is created in a union directory,
it is placed in the first element of the union that permits creation.
.TP
.B -A
For 
.I mount
only. Do not authenticate the connection to the server before proceeding with
.IR mount .
Otherwise the connection is authenticated by
.IR security-auth (2).
.TP
.BI -C " alg"
For
.I mount
only,
specify the algorithm, 
.IR alg ,
to be used following authentication for digesting or encryption. See 
.IR ssl (3)
for the supported algorithms.
The default is
.BR none :
.IR ssl (3)
is not used after authentication.
.TP
.BI -f " kfile "
For mount only, specify the keyfile to be used when authenticating.
The default is
.BI /usr/ user /keyring/default .
See 
.IR keyring-auth (2)
for more details.
.PP
A union directory unites the contents of the source and target directories.
If the same name appears in both directories, the name used is the one in the
directory that is bound before the other.
In particular, if the directories have subdirectories of the same name, only
the contents of the subdirectory in the top directory will be seen.
If the subdirectory contents are themselves to be united, that must be done
first in a separate
.I bind
or
.IR mount .
.SH CAVEAT
The
.B #
character in the name of a kernel device
must be quoted when used in a
.I bind
or
.I unmount
command, or the shell will take it as the start of a comment.
