.TH WM-CPROF 1
.SH NAME
wm/cprof \- graphic coverage profiling of limbo programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wm/cprof
[
.B -er
] [
.BI -m " modname"
] ... [
.BI "cmd arg ..."
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wm/cprof
is a graphical coverage profiling tool which shows which lines of limbo source have not been
executed. It can accumulate results over a series of runs if so desired.
.PP
The
.B -r
options indicates that the profiling results should be recorded. Any profiled dis file
of the form <name>.dis will have the raw profiling results stored in a file named
<name>.prf. If this file already existed before the run, the results will be added to
this file.
.PP
The
.B -m
option lists the module names which are to be profiled. If none are given, all the
modules loaded by the kernel will be profiled. The name may be the actual name of
the module or its path name.
.PP
The
.B -e
option profiles the module that is loaded first in any following command. In this case
there is no need to give a
.B -m
option as this is added automatically.
.PP
Any remaining arguments are assumed to
specify a command and set of arguments to the command. If this is the case,
.B wm/cprof
will automatically start profiling, run the command to completion and then
stop profiling before optionally recording the results and showing the profile statistics.
.PP
If no command is given to profile, then
.B wm/cprof
will show the profile statistics from any existing recorded results in .prf files instead.
.PP
.B Wm/cprof
displays the profile statistics graphically. Code that has not been executed is shown
in white against a red background. Code whose corresponding dis instructions have
not been wholly executed are shown in red against a white background. Typically a
line of code such as
.EX
	x = !x;
.EE
might show only partial execution if x has changed value from 1 to 0 but not
vice-verse.
.PP
The top of the text window names the module along with any modules before and
after it in the list. If a module has 100% coverage this is stated as well. To help find
unexecuted code, use the find icon in the menu bar. To move to the next or go back to 
any other profiled modules, use the arrow icons in the menu bar. The last icon, the reload 
icon, pops up a menu of profiled modules to choose from.
.PP
.B wm/cprof
calls
cprof to do the actual work.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLE
.EX
To profile a particular command
	wm/cprof /dis/math/sieve 100
To profile the same command but restrict attention to its own module (Partitions).
	wm/cprof -m Sieve /dis/math/sieve 100
A shorter version of the above
	wm/cprof -e /dis/math/sieve 100
Make 3 runs recording results as we go using cprof for simplicity
	cprof -e -r /dis/math/sieve 100
	cprof -e -r /dis/math/sieve 1000
	cprof -e -r /dis/math/sieve 10000
Now look at the cumulative results graphically
	wm/cprof -m /dis/math/sieve.dis
