.SH SYNOPSIS
.RB du [ \-santxy ]
.RI [ "file ..." ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B du
command outputs to standard output the total size of files specified as arguments.
Output sums are rounded up to the nearest 1k unit (1024 bytes).
.PP
Directories are recursively tallied.
If no filenames are provided,
the command operates on the current directory.
.PP
.I Du
accepts the following options:
.TP
.BR \-s  " (default)"
Output the usage information tallied for each directory.
.TP
.B \-a
Output usage information for each file,
not just the directories.
.TP
.B \-n
Output just the filenames,
no other information.
Warning messages are generated for ``unsafe'' filenames
(i.e., names containing shell special characters).
.TP
.B \-t
When used with the
.B \-n
option,
outputs the filename,
modification time, (seconds since the epoch),
size (in bytes),
and checksum.
This option has no effect in the absence of the
.B \-n
option.
.PP
The options
.BR \-s ,
.BR \-a , 
and

are mutually exclusive.

.SH BUGS

option is always 0;
it is intended to be used by some other commands as yet not distributed.
