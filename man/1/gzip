.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Gzip
and
.B gunzip
perform data compression and decompression
to and from the standard
.I gzip
file format.
If no arguments are given
.B gzip
compresses each
.I file
replacing it by a file of the same
name with the a
.B .gz
suffix appended.
If no files are given, standard input
and standard output are used.
.I Level
is a single decimal digit between 1 and 9;
higher numbers give better compression.
The default
.I level
is 6.
The
.B \-v
option causes
.B gzip
to report the compression ratio of each file that
it compresses.
.PP
.B Gunzip
performs the opposite operation to
.BR gzip ;
each
.I file
(which must have a
.B .gz
suffix) is uncompressed, and replaced
by a file of the same name with the
.B .gz
suffix removed. If no files are given,
standard input and standard output are used.
