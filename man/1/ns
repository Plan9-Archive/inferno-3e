.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ns
[
.I pid
]
.PP
.B nsv
[

[
.I pid
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ns
displays the construction of the namespace of the current process
or, if an argument is given, the process whose process id is given.
The resulting output is a series of binds and mounts in the order
they were performed. These will have been executed by the
kernel, the init process and/or user processes.
.PP
.I Nsv
behaves in a similar fashion to
.I ns
but it outputs the name space as a series of mount points with 
a list of directories bound to the mount point in the order that
they are searched by the operating system. The
.B -h
option prints a usage message and the
.B -m
option produces a machine readable version of the name space.
