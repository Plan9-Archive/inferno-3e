.TH DB 6
.SH NAME
db \- connection service database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /services/cs/db
.SH DESCRIPTION
The connection service database file is read by the connection server
.IR cs (8) ,
when it receives a request using a machine name of the form
.BI $ service\f1.
.PP
The file consists of a two column list (separated by whitespace) of the form:
.IP
.BI $ service"	hostname"
.PP
If the
.I hostname
is a logical network name,
the connection server subsequently
converts it to a network address
(eg, from domain name to Internet address)
before replying to its client.
.PP
Blank lines and comments (lines beginning with
.BR # )
are ignored.
.PP
.I Cs
takes care to update any name cache it maintains if it sees that the file has
changed since it was last read (based on its modification time).
