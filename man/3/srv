.TH SRV 3
.SH NAME
srv \- server registry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.EX
bind '#s' /chan

sys->bind("#s", "/chan", Sys->MREPL);
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Srv
converts between file system operations by applications
and messages on channels, as described in
.IR sys-file2chan (2).
Each attach
produces a new instance: an empty directory owned
by the current user in which only files
may be created, and then only by
.IR sys-file2chan ,
using a special internal interface.
Each such file initially has the same owner as the
directory, and permissions
.B 8r600
(read-write for the owner only),
but the permissions can be changed by
.IR sys-wstat
(see
.IR sys-stat (2))
and thus
.IR chmod (1).
.PP
Files may be removed, directly using
.IR sys-remove (2)
(and thus
.IR rm (1)),
and indirectly by opening them with mode
.B Sys->ORCLOSE
(see
.IR sys-open (2)).
.I File2chan
also removes the corresponding file when the last references
to the server's read and write channels have gone
(eg, on server exit).
