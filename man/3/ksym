.TH KSYM 3
.SH NAME
ksym \- kernel symbols
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bind -a '#N' /dev
.PP
.B /dev/ksym
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ksym
is intended to aid native kernel and
.IR emu (1)
monitoring and debugging.
It maps kernel addresses to symbolic names obtained from the symbol
table of a kernel executable.
It also arranges that the format
.L %N
if used by the kernel
.IR print (10.2)
will produce a symbolic address instead of a hexadecimal number
when a known address is printed.
.PP
.I Ksym
serves a directory containing a single file,
.BR ksym .
.PP
A write to the file must provide UTF-encoded lines containing commands or map entries,
each line ended by a newline character.
A line may be split across two writes to allow a symbol file to be copied into
the device by
.IR cat (1)
or
.IR cp (1).
There are two commands:
.TP
.B clear
Empty the current map. The map is also emptied by each write to file offset 0.
.TP
.B kernel
Make entries for
.L _kzero
and
.LR etext ,
representing the start and end of the kernel text segment.
.PD
.PP
Each map entry has the form:
.IP
.I "address name"
.PP
where
.I address
is an 8 digit unsigned hexadecimal number and
.I name
is a UTF encoded string giving
the symbolic name to be associated with that address in the current map.
.PP
The file may be read to see the contents of the current map.
Each read returns as many lines of the following form as will fit
in the caller's buffer:
.IP
.I "address name"
.PP
where
.I address
and
.I name
are as defined above for a write request.
