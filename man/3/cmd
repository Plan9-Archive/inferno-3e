.TH CMD 3 emu
.SH NAME
cmd \- interface to host operating system commands
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bind -a '#C' /
.PP
.B /cmd/clone
.br
.BI /cmd/ n /ctl
.br
.BI /cmd/ n /data
.br
.BI /cmd/ n /status
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I cmd
device provides an interface to commands on the host operating system,
when running
.IR emu (1).
By convention, this kernel device
.RB ( #C )
is bound to the root directory (with the
.B -a
option).
.PP
Opening
the
.B clone
file provides a handle for starting a command, managing the command's I/O, and checking the command's status.
It
creates or allocates a currently unused directory,
.I n
under
.B /cmd
(where
.I n
is a decimal integer).
It contains the
files
.BR ctl ,
.BR data ,
and
.BR status .
The file descriptor returned from the open of
.B clone
provides access to the
.B ctl
file of the directory selected by
.IR cmd .
.PP
Reading
.B ctl
via the file descriptor returned from opening
.B clone
provides the directory
number,
.IR n ,
which can then be used to construct filenames for the related files.
Writes to
.B ctl
must have the format:
.IP
.BI "exec " "oscmd args ..."
.PP
File offset is ignored for both reading and writing.
.PP
Reading
.B data
obtains the data that the command writes to its standard output and standard error.
Writing to
.B data
sends the data into the command's standard input.
.PP
The read-only
.B status
file provides a status line (to a maximum of 128 bytes) of the format:
.IP
.BI cmd/ "n refcnt state cmd arg ..."
.PP
where each field separator is a single blank. The meaning of each field is:
.TP
.I n
The
.I cmd
directory number.
.TP
.I refcnt
The number (decimal) of open file descriptors for
.BR ctl .
.TP
.I state
The status of the interface in directory
.IR n :
.RS
.TF Execute
.TP
.B Open
Allocated for use but not yet running a command.
.TP
.B Execute
Running a command
.TP
.B Close
Command completed. Available for reallocation via
.BR clone .
.RE
.TP
.I "cmd arg" ...
The active command. Output only for state
.BR Execute .
.PP
.SS "Command execution"
On Unix systems,
the command is run via
.B /bin/sh
as follows:
.IP
.EX
.BI "/bin/sh -c '" cmd args... "'"
.EE
.PP
The command will be run using the Unix user and group ID of
the user that started
.IR emu (1),
unless it was started by the super-user, in which case
.I cmd
attempts to set the Unix user ID and group ID to those of a Unix user corresponding to
the current Inferno user's name, and failing that, as user and group
.BR nobody .
.PP
On Plan 9,
the command is run via
.B /bin/rc
as follows:
.IP
.EX
.BI "/bin/rc -c '" cmd args... "'"
.EE
.PP
The command will be run using the Plan 9 identity of
the user that started
.IR emu (1).
.PP
On Windows systems,
the command must be a binary executable (not built into the command interpreter) in the current path.
It is always run with the same Windows user identity as started
.IR emu (1).
Furthermore,
the
.B ctl
file transforms all slashes not quoted or escaped by backslashes to backslashes in the command string
before executing it.
.SH SOURCE

.SH BUGS
Standard output and standard error ideally should not be mingled.
.br
Exit status should be available.
.br
The maximum length of a command string is 128 bytes.
