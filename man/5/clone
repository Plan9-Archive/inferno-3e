.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f5clone\fP request carries as arguments an existing \f2fid\fP and a proposed \f2newfid\fP
(which must not be in use)
that the client wishes to associate with
the same file as \f2fid\fP.
The \f2fid\fP must be valid in the current session and must not have been opened for I/O
by an \f5open\fP or \f5create\fP message.
After a successful \f5clone\fP and before any subsequent messages,
\f2fid\fP and \f2newfid\fP are indistinguishable.
