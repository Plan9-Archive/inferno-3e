.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nop
request does nothing overt but may be used to synchronize the channel initially.
.PP
The
.B tag
should be
.B notag
(value
.BR 16rFFFF )
for a
.B nop
message.
.PP
The
.B attach
message serves as a fresh introduction from a user on the client machine to a server.
The message identifies the user
.RI ( uid )
and may select the file tree to access
.RI ( aname ).
.PP
As a result of the
.B attach
transaction, the client will have a connection to the root
directory of the desired file tree, represented by
.IR fid .
An error is returned if
.I fid
is already in use.
The server's idea of the root of the file tree is represented by the returned
.IR qid .
.SH ENTRY POINTS
An
.B attach
transaction will be generated for kernel devices (see
.IR intro (3)).
when a system call evaluates a file name beginning with
.BR # .
A
.B mount
call (see
.IR sys-bind (2))
generates an
.B attach
message to the remote file server.
When the kernel boots, an
.B attach
is made to the root device,
.IR root (3),
and then an \f5attach\fP is made to the requested file server machine.
