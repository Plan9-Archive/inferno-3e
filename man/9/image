image \- Create and manipulate images
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f5image\fR \fIoption \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f5image\fR command is used to create, delete, and query images.
It can take several different forms, depending on the
\fIoption\fR argument.  The legal forms are:
.TP
\f5image create bitmap \fR?\fIname\fR? ?\fIoption value ...\fR?
Creates a new image and returns its name.
\fIname\fR specifies the name for the image;  if it is omitted then
Tk picks a name of the form \f5image\fIx\fR, where \fIx\fR is
an integer.
A bitmap image is defined by two bitmaps, called the \fIsource\fR
and the \fImask\fR.
The \fIsource\fR is displayed whereever the \fImask\fP
has a non-zero pixel, otherwise nothing will be displayed, producing
a transparent effect. The two bitmaps must have the same dimensions.
The following options are supported:
.RS
.TP
\f5-file \fIname\fR
\fIname\fR gives the name of a file whose contents define the
source bitmap.
The file must be in
.IR image (6)
format.
.TP
\f5-maskfile \fIname\fR
\fIname\fR gives the name of a file whose contents define the
mask. The file must be in
.IR image (6)
format.
.RE
.PP
If an image already exists by the given name then it is replaced
with the new image and any instances of that image will redisplay
with the new contents.
.TP
\f5image delete \fR?\fIname name\fR ...?
Deletes each of the named images and returns an empty string.
If there are instances of the images displayed in widgets,
the images won't actually be deleted until all of the instances
are released.
However, the association between the instances and the image
manager will be dropped.
Existing instances will retain their sizes but redisplay as
empty areas.
If a deleted image is recreated with another call to \f5image create\fR,
the existing instances will use the new image.
.TP
\f5image height \fIname\fR
Returns a decimal string giving the height of image \fIname\fR
in pixels.
.TP
\f5image names\fR
Returns a list containing the names of all existing images.
.TP
\f5image type \fIname\fR
Returns ``bitmap'' if
.I name
is an existing image, or an error otherwise.
.TP
\f5image width \fIname\fR
Returns a decimal string giving the width of image \fIname\fR
in pixels.
.SH BUGS
Currently, changing the bitmap associated with an image does
not change the appearance of any current instances of that image;
there is no ``image manager'' as such.
