.SH DESCRIPTION
These modules provide name and address translation in hosted and native modes.
.PP
.B Srv
is a module built in to
.IR emu (1)
that accesses the Internet name resolution services
of a host operating system.
.PP
Given a host name,
.B Iph2a
returns a list of its Internet addresses (if any).
Given an Internet address,
.B ipa2h
returns a list of host names (if any) that have that address.
The results are only as accurate as the host system's name service.
.PP
.B Ipn2p
returns the port number (as a string) for the given
.I service
when accessed using a particular protocol
.I protocol
(typically
.B tcp
or
.BR udp ).
.PP
.B Ipsrv
provides a superset of the
.IR srv (2)
interface for name and address translation.
It can be used in both hosted and native modes.
It has an additional
.B init
function that must be called before any of the other functions is used;
its argument should be
.BR nil .
It uses the Internet Domain Name Service (DNS) for both host name lookup
and reverse (address) lookup.
The addresses of the DNS servers, which must be numeric IP addresses,
and an (optional) local domain name
are read from
.BR /services/dns/db .
It uses
.IR services (6)
to map protocol and service names to Internet port numbers.

.SH BUGS
.B Srv
should have an
.B init
function.
On the other hand,
.B Ipsrv
should not take arguments to its
.B init
function.
.br
.B Ipsrv
uses TCP/IP not UDP/IP to access the DNS.
