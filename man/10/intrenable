.TH INTRENABLE 10.2
.SH NAME
intrenable \- interrupt handler registration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ta \w'\fLvoid* 'u
.B
void intrenable(int v, void (*f)(Ureg*, void*), void* a, int tbdf);
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Intrenable
registers
.I f
to be executed by the system on receipt of the interrupt defined by
the platform-dependent encoding
.I v
(it is often an interrupt level, but can be more complex).
The pointer
.I a
is passed to
.IR f .
The
.I tbdf
parameter is a platform-dependent value that
denotes the type of bus, bus instance, device number and function
(cf. the PCI device indexing scheme).
.PP
A linked list of such functions is maintained per interrupt level. The intrenable function inserts the current function at the head of that list.
.PP
There is no mechanism for removing an interrupt handler from the list.
.PP
The Ureg structure provided to f contains the registers at the time of interrupt. The contents are platform specific;
see the include file
.BR "u.h" .
