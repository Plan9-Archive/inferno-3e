.SH SYNOPSIS
.B archfs
[
.B -s
]
[
.B -m mountpoint
]
.I archfile 
[
.I prefix ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Archfs
mounts the file 
.I archfile
in archive format on the given
.I mountpoint
directory. The mount is read only. Typically the archive file will have been created by 
.I mkfs
or
.IR create .
Any further names after the archive file name are treated as prefixes and only files in the
archive whose path names begin with one of these prefixes are actually shown under the
mount point.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B -m mountpoint
specifies the actual mount point for the archive. The default is
.I /mnt.
.TP
.B -s
indicates that the rest of the archive can be skipped once a file is found in the archive which
does not start with any of the given prefixes. This is useful when an archive is known to
contain a description of it's contents in the form of a series of header files at the beginning
of the archive and all we wish to show under the mount point are the header files.
