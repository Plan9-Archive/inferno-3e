.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Memfs
mounts a newly created heap-based filesystem
on the given
.I mountpoint
directory.
.PP
The filesystem is entirely maintained in memory, no external storage is used.
Unless specified by
.IR size,
the maximum storage provided by the filesystem is 1 megabyte (1024*1024 bytes).
File data is allocated in 512 byte blocks.
If a maximum
.I size
is specified, the actual maximum is rounded down to the nearest
whole number of blocks:
.IP
.EX
actualsize := (size / 512) * 512;
.EE
.PP
The root of the new filesystem is created with Read, Write and Execute permission for the
user only (mode 8r700).  The owner is given by the value returned from
.B /dev/user
at the time of running the command.
.PP
.I Memfs

.TP
.B \-r
The default option.
The old
.I mountpoint

represented by the
.I mountpoint
directory.
.TP
.B \-b
